# CaptchaWare

This is a side project I am developing using the GameMaker 2 game engine. It is a WarioWare style game where the microgames are based off of Captchas.

## Current Features:
* A structure to load in microgames via Sequences in GameMaker
* 4 current microgames
* Online leaderboards (WIP)

## Extensions Used:

YoYo Games Firebase Extension for the Firebase functionality - https://github.com/YoYoGames/GMEXT-Firebase/wiki/firestore
